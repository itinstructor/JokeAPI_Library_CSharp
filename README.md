### Purpose
I am an Information Technology Instructor at Western Nebraska Community College. I teach Information Technology Technical Support, CyberSecurity and Computer Science.

This library was created for a Visual C# introductory programming class as a tutorial. Students are given the opportunity to learn how to consume a public API without the underlying complexity of parsing json or xml. It reinforces OOP concepts of objects and properties, while being a fun and interesting project.
